searches for active refund scam numbers on nomorobo.com

Old small project of mine, be sure to add an excel file in the same directory with the name: "Numbers.xlsx" so the script can save the numbers in that file 

The script makes use of the Nomorobo database of scam nubmers, and filters out all amazon or refund scamcalls by searching for specific words in the transcription of the numbers.
